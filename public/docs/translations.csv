This  
introduction  
to Aristotle’s Metaphysics  
opens the way to the theology  
of the philosophers:  
that is, to the philosophy  
most excellent through  
divine and eternal  
principles of reasoning.",summer_2025

Revised from the archetypes, with new commentaries on the text:  
let them now appear for the happy success of Parisian and other schools,  
and bring help to letters. Now, therefore, young men, draw from the Aristotelian work  
waters purest from their own source, and taste them.  
Avoid foreign waters, as foul and unhealthy pools.  
For nearly every evil in studies has arisen from this:  
that, abandoning the writings and the very authors,  
men have given themselves entirely to vain glosses.  
And those who do not follow the true authors (as if bees were to follow drones)  
have taken such as their guides and leaders.  
But now, consult better for the condition of your studies.  
If you undertake the art of dialectic with moderation,  
it will follow that all good disciplines will return.  
And all good disciplines are accompanied by uprightness of morals  
and grace of life, with every virtue.  
This above all we desire and earnestly pray may be attained through your studies.",summer_2025

The first volume of the *Contemplations*  
of Raymond, containing two books.

The booklet *Blaquerna*, on the Friend and the Beloved.

Epigram by Beatus Rhenanus of Alsace  
to the reader.

Behold, pious Raymond goes forth into the wide world,  
Who shall often bring great benefits to many.  
He lies not condemned in obscure darkness:  
His page is free of trivial ornament.  
Within unpolished words lie hidden lofty things,  
Worthy to raise up devout minds.  
Now Raymond had lived full thirty years,  
A foolish, slothful, idle man of pleasures;  
Leaving behind the world’s deceitful joys,  
He tames his body harshly upon a rugged rock.  
Returning to seek the stream where he cleanses life’s sins,  
He receives the father’s generous gifts.  
Late at length he seeks the first rudiments of language,  
After five times eight years of life accomplished.  
Falling first upon grammar, he left the island of art,  
Entangled in countless books of simplicity.  
Therefore, whoever unrolls these worthy labors:  
Aid him with this prayer (whenever the work requires restoration).",summer_2025

For long ages the learned sisters have lain hidden,

And they teach all the measures that exist beneath the world.

Has drawn both men and beasts, the Thracian kind;
